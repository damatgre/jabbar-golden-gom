## Description

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive quiz. The quiz centers around Marvel universe characters and allows the user to test their knowledge on 5 quick questions. 

The user is prompted at the welcome screen to click the Start button. They are then introduced to the quiz, one question at a time. Throughout the quiz, they are told whether their answers are correct or incorrect. When selecting an incorrect answer, 5 seconds are removed from the timer. At the end, the user is able to submit their name. The name of the user and their score is then transferred to local storage.
